Since it seems e.StartIndex is already "the next item", i back up the old algorithm…

	// Note 2: We'll assume that we are always searching forward. (This is important for "proximity" search)
	// Note 3: Now that I think about it, maybe I can merge the two "separate" phases of the search into one loop.
	// But this would lead to an algorithm somewhat different from a regular binary search. (If it isn't already… ;))
