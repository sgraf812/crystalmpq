Overlays may be composed of one or more texture.
We have the overlay's dimensions in fields 9 & 10,
and a texture can have a maximum size (x or y) of 256.
Based on that it's easy to calculate the number of textures used.
Textures will be named Overlay1.blp Overlay2.blp ... OverlayN.blp
Usually there should not be more than 4 textures
