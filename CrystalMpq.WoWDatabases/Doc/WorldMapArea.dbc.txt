WorldMapArea.dbc

Field	Contents
0	ID
1	Map.ID
2	AreaTable.ID
3	Internal Area Name
4	y1
5	y2
6	x1
7	x2
8	Flag for in-game world map information

The flag works as following:
If it is -1, then the map ID in field 1 works for everything
If it is >=0, then the map where the zone resides is the one pointed by field 1,
but the map where the zone is "seen" is the map ID in field 8
